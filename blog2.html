            <p><b>My Experience Snorkeling with Humpback Whales off the Silver Bank, Atlantic Ocean
                I slid into the Atlantic Ocean off the small boat like a seal sliding off a rock and into the water. 
                I heard my breathing through my snorkel and blinked while focusing on the deep blue beyond.
                Suddenly, there they were, a 40 foot (12.2m) long mother humpback whale with her 15 foot (4.6m) long calf circling her.

                There were full body shots of the mother and calf, and body parts like flukes or the long pectoral fins filling the 
                entire frame.</b></p>
